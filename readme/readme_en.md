# GeoRoulette

**GeoRoulette** is an open-source project for a game where random geographical coordinates are generated, and the goal is to find the country closest to these coordinates.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game**: Execute the `main.py` file to start a new game.

2. **Generate Coordinates**: The game will automatically generate random geographical coordinates.

3. **Player Input**: Each player should enter the name of the country they believe is closest to the generated coordinates.

4. **Determine Winner**: After all players have submitted their choices, the game will reveal the correct answer, display each player's responses, and announce the player who selected the closest answer.

5. **Play Again**: The game can be played multiple times by rerunning the `main.py` file.

## Dependencies

GeoRoulette requires the following Python libraries:

- **geopy**: Used for calculating the distance between geographical coordinates and countries.
- **pandas**: Used to read the country data file.
- **folium**: Provides an interactive map display of countries.
- **numpy**: Performs various mathematical calculations.
- **geopandas**: Handles geospatial data and operations.
- **shapely**: Used for geometric operations.
- **matplotlib**: Provides plotting and visualization capabilities.
